Scraping, topic extraction and analysis of Amazon reviews for Amazon Fire 7 tablet

Over 10,000 reviews have been scraped from Amazon for the Amazon Fire 7 tablet. I have then tried using an Autoencoder to extract the most popular
topics from the reviews. I have then performed analysis on these topics. The main file is review_analysis.ipynb to see the analysis.
